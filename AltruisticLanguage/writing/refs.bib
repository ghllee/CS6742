  title={How Different are Crowdfunders? Examining Archetypes of Crowdfunders and Their Choice of Projects},
  institution={SSRN},
  author={Wan Lin and Wai Fong Boh and Kim Huat Goh},
  url={http://ssrn.com/abstract=2397571},

  abstract={
  While current research treats all crowdfunders on the same platform as a homogeneous group, we argue that such an assumption may limit our understanding of the complexities of the crowdfunder community. In this paper, we begin to unpack the complexities of the crowdfunder community by identifying different archetypes of crowdfunders funding technology projects on Kickstarter, we identified four distinct types of crowdfunders: Active Backers, Trend Followers, the Altruistic, and the Crowd. Our results show that crowdfunders on the same platform are highly heterogeneous, with different motivations that are reflected in their strategies and behaviors. We further hypothesized and tested how the strategies and motivations of different crowdfunder archetypes further influence their choices of when and which projects to fund. In so doing, we not only reconcile conflicting results from the literature, but also synthesize differing theoretical perspectives that have been applied to understand the crowdfunding phenomenon.
